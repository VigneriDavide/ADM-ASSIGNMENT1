# ADM-ASSIGNMENT1
The current folder consists of two files: 'scripts.ipynb' and 'stamps.pdf'.

## The 'scripts.ipynb' file
This jupyter-notebook file contains my solutions for 91 chalenges and 6 algorithms on HackerRank.
The file can be split up in two sections:
 - in Problem 1 you find the solutions of 91 challenges from the following Hackerank chapters: Introduction, Data types, Strings, Sets, Collections, Date and Time, Exception*[^1], Built-ins*, Python Functionas*, Regex and Parsing challenges, XML, Closure and Decorations, Numpy.
[^1]: Note that the symbol '*' next to the name of a chapter means that not all the problems of that chapter have been solved.

The structure of this section is the following:

                            .
                            .

                            Exn-name_Exn
  
- in Problem 2 you find the solutions of 6 problems present on Hackerank: _birthday cake candles_, _kangaroo_, _strange advertising_, _recursive digit sum_, _insertion sort1_, _insertion sort2_.

## The 'stamps.pdf' file
This pdf file, which you may find in the sub-folder _stamps_, contains the screenshots of the submissions[^note] of the Hackerank problems.
